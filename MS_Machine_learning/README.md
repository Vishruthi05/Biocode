MACHINE LEARNING - LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL

The presented model is a Logistic Regression,designed to discern between diseased and healthy samples within the provided dataset. Leveraging a robust mathematical framework, this predictive tool harnesses the power of regression analysis to make informed assessments based on the input features.

The foundation of this model lies in the meticulous curation of data sourced from the geo datasets of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Specifically, the focus is on Multiple Sclerosis, a complex neurological condition. The key determinant in discerning between healthy and diseased samples lies in the expression levels of crucial genes. Leveraging the powerful GEO2R analysis tool, the GeoDataset systematically defines distinct groups within the dataset, providing invaluable insights through metrics such as p-values and log-fold change values. These metrics serve as critical indicators, shedding light on which genes are overexpressed or underexpressed in the context of Multiple Sclerosis. This detailed analysis forms the bedrock of the model's predictive capabilities, ensuring a robust approach to classification.

There are approximately 29 samples total in the dataset, including 15 control samples and 14 disease samples.
